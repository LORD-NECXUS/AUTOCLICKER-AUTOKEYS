# AutoClicker + AutoKeys

**AutoClicker + AutoKeys** is a Python application developed with Tkinter, combining the features of an auto-clicker and an auto-key presser. It allows the user to configure automatic click intervals and define multiple keyboard keys to be pressed automatically at specific intervals.

## Features

- **Auto-Clicker**: Automate mouse clicks with custom intervals in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
- **Auto-Key Presser**: Configure multiple keyboard keys to be pressed automatically at defined intervals. Each key can have its own interval in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
- **Multi-language Support**: The interface supports multiple languages (French, English, Russian, Spanish) and allows easy switching between them.
- **Clickable Link**: Displays a "BY NECXUS" clickable tag at the bottom of the application, which redirects to a YouTube channel.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `F6` to start/stop the auto-clicker.
  - `F7` to start/stop the auto-key presser.

## Interval Configuration

### Auto-Clicker
- Enter values in the `hours`, `mins`, `secs`, and `milliseconds` fields.
- Click the `Start Autoclick F6` button to begin.

### Auto-Key Presser
- Click `Add Key` and enter the keyboard key you want to automate.
- Set the time intervals in `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, and `milliseconds` for that key.
- Click `Start Autokey F7` to start automating the key presses.
